# Bamazon Challenge 1 Customer View

#Overview:
In this assigment we are asked to create an app that can take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory based on the order placed. 

We created a database using  mySql workbench with 10 different products each item having a product id number, a product name, a department name, price & stock quantity.
When prompted the customer is asked to choose which product they would like to buy, after product is chosen they are then prompted & asked how much of that particular product they would like to buy. Once the product & quantity are chosen, it is subtracted from the quantity of product in stock.
